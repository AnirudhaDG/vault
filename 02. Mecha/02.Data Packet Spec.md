The following describes the data frame transmitted by the Comet to the extension upon successful detection. Each frame consists of the following bytes:

- **Start Byte**: Indicates the beginning of the data packet.
    - A value of `0xAA` signifies a valid data packet.
- **Authentication Key Byte**: Used to authenticate the source of the data received, ensuring it originates from the Comet.
- **Data Request Byte**: Identifies the specific data being requested from the extension.
    - `0x01` – Request the unique identifier (UID) of the extension.
    - `0x02` – Request information about the extension type (e.g., input or output).
    - Other addresses are reserved for later use
- **Data Bytes 0/1/2**: Contains any data to be written to the extension once the connection is established.
- **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**: Contains the checksum value, calculated using a predefined polynomial (to be determined), for data integrity verification.
- **Stop Byte**: Marks the end of the data packet.
    - A value of `0xFF` signifies a valid data packet.

Example:
Request Packet: {0xAA, 0x55, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF}
- 0xAA (Constant start byte)
- 0x55 (Constant auth key byte)
- 0x01 (Data Identification byte for UID request)
- 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 (No data to be sent along with UID request, redundancy)
- 0x00 (CRC default 0x00 calculated by function duing transmission)
- 0xFF (Constant stop byte)
```

### Response Data Frame
![[response_frame_f.jpg]]
The following describes the data frame transmitted by the extension to the Comet upon receiving a data request packet. Each frame consists of the following bytes:

- **Start Byte**: Indicates the beginning of the data packet.
    - A value of `0x11` signifies a valid data packet.
- **Data Identification Byte**: Identifies the data being sent to the Comet.
    - `0x01` – Unique identifier (UID) of the extension.
    - `0x02` – Extension type (e.g., input or output).
    - Other addresses are reserved for later use
- **Data Bytes 0-4:** Data that is requested by the Comet
- **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**: Contains the checksum value, calculated using a predefined polynomial (to be determined), for data integrity verification.
- **Stop Byte**: Marks the end of the data packet.

Example:
Response Packet: {0xAA, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0xA0, 0x66, 0x00, 0xFF}
- 0xAA (Constant start byte)
- 0x01 (Data Identification byte for UID request)
- 0x00, 0x00, 0xA0, 0x66 (UID: 0x0000A066)
- 0x00 (CRC default 0x00 calculated by function duing transmission)
- 0xFF (Constant stop byte)
